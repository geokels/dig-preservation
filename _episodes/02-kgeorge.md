![Image of first power point slide. Text on slide reads Cultivating a culture of digital preservation inside academic libraries and out, a presentation given by Kelsey George, Cataloging and Metadata Strategies Librarian. URL to github DOT com slash geokels included. On left side of slide there is a comic of a woman at a computer talking to a man holding a coffee cup. The text of the comic says I liked it before big data and metadata when we just had good old regular data.](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx1.PNG) "**Introduction Slide**"

![Image of second power point slide. Text on slide reads: Digitization does not equal access. Digitization does not equal preservation. Digitization without a long term storage and preservation plan is a waste of time and resources. One left side of slide there is an image of a page from a Book of Hours with shepherds gazing up at an angel. There is text overlaying the picture that says Hark! The herald angels sing, no, we can't digitize everything! Happy Holidays from Derangement and Description.](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx2.PNG) "**Slide Two**"

Digitization is not always equivalent to access. 
Many obstacles exist when trying to make digitized materials accessible.

Digital file formats are susceptible to bit rot, file degradation, file corruption, and generation loss over time. 


* [Bit rot] : *the inability to access digital data because the file format is obsolete and compatible applications no longer exist to read it*
* [File or data degradation] : *the gradual corruption of computer data due to an accumulation of non-critical failures in a data storage device*
* [File corruption] : *corruption to data or program file accidentally by hardware or software failure. It causes the bits to be rearranged and renders it either unreadable to the hardware or, if readable, indecipherable to the program.*
* [Generation loss] : *loss of quality between subsequent copies or transcodes of data. Anything that reduces the quality of the representation when copying, and would cause further reduction in quality on making a copy of the copy, can be considered a form of generation loss.*

The Getty published a [post] in *The Iris* in 2014 describing how they act to prevent digital decay.

In order for digital objects to be preserved long-term, digital object storage and access to the objects cannot remain static as technologies change.

There are many organizations (national and international) currently working to solve the problems presented by digital preservation.

* [Library of Congress' *Digital Preservation Program*]
* [Digital Preservation Coalition]
* [The Digital Preservation Network]
* [POWRR]
* [Academic Preservation Trust]
* [Internet Archive]
* [Chronopolis]
* [Samvera *previously known as Hydra*]
* [Preservica]
