![Image of first power point slide. Text on slide reads Cultivating a culture of digital preservation inside academic libraries and out, a presentation given by Kelsey George, Cataloging and Metadata Strategies Librarian. URL to github DOT com slash geokels included. On left side of slide there is a comic of a woman at a computer talking to a man holding a coffee cup. The text of the comic says I liked it before big data and metadata when we just had good old regular data.](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx1.PNG) "**Introduction Slide**"

![Image of second power point slide. Text on slide reads: Digitization does not equal access. Digitization does not equal preservation. Digitization without a long term storage and preservation plan is a waste of time and resources. One left side of slide there is an image of a page from a Book of Hours with shepherds gazing up at an angel. There is text overlaying the picture that says Hark! The herald angels sing, no, we can't digitize everything! Happy Holidays from Derangement and Description.](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx2.PNG) "**Slide Two**"

Digitization is not always equivalent to access. 
Many obstacles exist when trying to make digitized materials accessible.

Digital file formats are susceptible to bit rot, file degradation, file corruption, and generation loss over time. 


* [Bit rot] : *the inability to access digital data because the file format is obsolete and compatible applications no longer exist to read it*
* [File or data degradation] : *the gradual corruption of computer data due to an accumulation of non-critical failures in a data storage device*
* [File corruption] : *corruption to data or program file accidentally by hardware or software failure. It causes the bits to be rearranged and renders it either unreadable to the hardware or, if readable, indecipherable to the program.*
* [Generation loss] : *loss of quality between subsequent copies or transcodes of data. Anything that reduces the quality of the representation when copying, and would cause further reduction in quality on making a copy of the copy, can be considered a form of generation loss.*

The Getty published a [post] in *The Iris* in 2014 describing how they act to prevent digital decay.

In order for digital objects to be preserved long-term, digital object storage and access to the objects **cannot** remain static as technologies change.



![Image of third power point slide. Image in center of the slide is the distracted boyfriend meme, where a woman is walking and a man, holding another woman's hand, is checking her out while the other woman (presumed to be his girlfirend) stares up at him in disgust. The caption on the walking woman reads "digitization", on the man reads "funders", and on the disgusted girlfriend reads "digital perservation".](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx3.PNG) "**Slide Three**" (https://derangementanddescription.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/distracted-and-description/distracted_boyfriend_digitization/)

In library-land, particularly in American academic libraries, budgets for libraries have been reduced or have stayed the same for years while the cost of provided electronic access to journals and other materials has increased. The desire to innovate and stay on top of digital trends is there, but many times the funding does not match the motivation. Often, donors will donate collections or donate funding on the condition that materials be digitized, but donors may not always have an understanding of or desire to fund the infrastructure required to make their collections available online long-term. 

In addition to digitization costs, other factors to consider include:
* Copyright issues
* Whether materials will be preserved in a separate preservation repository
* What level of access will be granted to the collection
* Development of access, preservation, and descriptive metadata
* Personnel available
* Storage space and cost (for both digital and physical materials)
* Preservation costs (for both digital and physical materials)

Libraries without digital preservation policies and infrastructure have the option of accepting donations and then seeking out additional donors/university support, or they have to turn away collections due to a lack of resources. Ideally, libraries should already be connecting with internal (campus) and external (community) stakeholders to get support to preserve collections held in the library.


![Image of fourth power point slide. Image in center of the slide is a relief panel of the great Ludovisi sarcophagus, depicting a carved battle scene. Text at the top of the slide reads "Battle over the institutional repository"](https://github.com/geokels/dig-preservation/blob/gh-pages/fig/kdg_ppx4.PNG) "**Slide Four**"

There are many organizations (national and international) currently working to solve the problems presented by digital preservation.

* [Library of Congress' *Digital Preservation Program*]
* [Digital Preservation Coalition]
* [The Digital Preservation Network]
* [POWRR]
* [Academic Preservation Trust]
* [Internet Archive]
* [Chronopolis]
* [Samvera *previously known as Hydra*]
* [Preservica]
