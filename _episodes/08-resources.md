### Additional Resources 

#### Relevant Standards/Resources for Digital Preservation

*	[POWRR] *Preserving (Digital) Objects With Restricted Resources*
*	[Digital Preservation in a Box] *Digital Preservation in a Box is a product of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's Outreach Working Group and is designed as a toolkit to support outreach activities that introduce the basic concepts of preserving digital information. The DPB provides the best available resources and tools to help you communicate digital preservation and stewardship concepts and issues.*
*	[Digital Preservation Coalition's *Digital Preservation Handbook 2nd Edition.*] *The Digital Preservation Coalition is a non-profit based in the UK and Ireland made up of member organizations who promote long-term accessibility of digital assets.* 
*	[Internet Archive] *Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. Archive-It enables you to capture, manage and search collections of digital content without any technical expertise or hosting facilities.*
*	[Digital Preservation Management Tutorial: Implementing Short Term Strategies for Long Term Problems] *Support for this tutorial comes from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The tutorial was developed by Cornell University Library and is now hosted and maintained by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Tutorials available in English, French, and Italian.*
* [Digital Data Management for a New Generation] *These materials are geared toward early training in best practices. Such practices ultimately support long-term management—including upload into digital data archives and institutional repositories—and facilitate data sharing where appropriate. Hosted by the American Anthropological Association.*
* [Facing Off with Digital Preservation Policy] *A crosswalk between digital preservation policies of thirteen diverse institutions, developed by Kristin Snawder, a 2011 Junior Fellow working with NDIIPP*
* [Archaeology Data Service / Digital Antiquity Guide to Good Practice] *A guide providing the basis for archaeological project workflows that will create digital datasets that can be archived and shared effectively by Digital Antiquity's tDAR archive and repository in the US and by the Archaeology Data Service in the UK*
* [MetaArchive] *The mission of the MetaArchive Cooperative is to foster better understanding of distributed digital preservation methods and to create enduring and stable, geographically dispersed “dark archives” of digital materials that can, if necessary, be drawn upon to restore collections at Member organizations.*
