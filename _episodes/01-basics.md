#### Digital preservation is the active management of digital content over time to ensure ongoing access

**Digital preservation does NOT mean that everything should be digitized**

Instead, digital preservation emphasizes the stewardship of born-digital and digitized objects throughout their lifecycle:

The three keys to creating long-term access to digital objects are:

*	Preserving
*	Curating
*	Maintaining discoverability

**Preservation is a means to provide access for future generations** 

Obstacles to the preservation of digital objects:
*	Degradation of object carrier *e.g. vinegar syndrome in microfiche, time and storage conditions affecting hard drives*
*	Restoring to "original" vs. conserving to prevent deterioration *e.g. "correcting" images of physical objects*
*	Format obsoletion *e.g. floppy discs*
*	HTTP Error 404 : Web page not found *e.g. webpages are not constant, URL's are not stable points of access*

Obstacles to curating digital objects:
* Lack of provenance *e.g. lack of preservation metadata, "no one knows where this harddrive came from", etc.*
* Lack of organization *e.g. born-digital objects have not been organized into collections or been given collection-level metadata, files have only non-specific file names, objects of the same collection were not digitized in the correct order or together, etc.*
* Lack of description *non-descript file names, no preservation or descriptive metadata attached to objects, "no one knows where this floppy disk came from or what's on it", etc.*

Obstacles to maintaining digital object discoverability:
* Broken URL's
* Lack of description *i.e. descriptive metadata*
* Lack of organization *e.g. file structures, databases, etc.*
* Lack of accessibility *e.g. lack of access metadata, local copy only, paywall, IP-restricted access, ADA non-compliance, etc.*
